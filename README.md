# ðŸ‘‹I'm Geloo, your friendly neighborhood Computer Engineering student.
Driven by curiosity, fueled by code<br>  
Computer Engineering student, currently diving into the world of web development. My long-term goal? To become a highly skilled and impactful software engineer, building innovative solutions and making a real difference.<br><br>
ðŸ‘€I love making websites look good and work well. I spend a lot of time creating designs and turning them into interactive web pages.

ðŸŒ±I'm planning to learn how to build entire websites, from the parts you see to the parts that make them work behind the scenes, so I can create complete web projects.

ðŸ’–I'm looking for a group of people who love building websites, so we can learn from each other and work on projects together.

ðŸŽ¨I'm really interested in making websites easy and enjoyable to use, by focusing on how they look and how people interact with them.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming online or out for a motorcycle ride.
